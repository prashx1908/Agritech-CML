A comprehensive digital platform for farmers, NGOs, and agri-organizations in Assam that provides personalized weather alerts, data-driven recommendations, and centralized farmer data management.


## 🚀  Prompts Documentation
When facing development challenges, use these high-level prompts to think like a senior developer:

### 1. **Port Conflict Resolution & Development Environment Setup**
**Complex:** *"How can I implement a robust development environment configuration with dynamic port allocation, process management, and automatic fallback strategies to prevent EADDRINUSE errors and ensure seamless concurrent development of frontend (Vite) and backend (Express) services while maintaining proper proxy configuration and hot reloading capabilities?"*

**Context:** Your terminal logs show repeated port conflicts on 5001, causing server crashes and development interruptions.

### 2. **Authentication & Session Management Architecture**
**Complex:** *"What enterprise-grade authentication system should I implement with role-based access control, session persistence, and secure token management to handle admin/user role switching, phone verification workflows, and maintain user state across page refreshes while ensuring proper logout functionality and conditional navigation rendering?"*

**Context:** Your Login component has hardcoded credentials and the Navbar shows inconsistent login state management.

### 3. **Multi-language Support & Regional Content Strategy**
**Complex:** *"How can I design a comprehensive internationalization architecture with dynamic language switching, cultural adaptation, and context-aware translations to provide seamless multilingual experience for Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, and other Northeast Indian languages while integrating with Google Translate and maintaining consistent UX patterns across all components?"*

**Context:** You have Google Translate integration but need proper i18n for regional languages.

### 4. **Payment Gateway Integration & Financial Security**
**Complex:** *"What secure payment processing architecture should I implement with Razorpay integration, transaction reconciliation, fraud detection, and comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable donation processing for agricultural projects while maintaining PCI DSS compliance and providing real-time payment status updates?"*

**Context:** Your Donations component has Razorpay integration but needs better error handling and security.

### 5. **Real-time Weather Data & Alert System**
**Complex:** *"How can I build a real-time weather monitoring system with intelligent alert generation, multi-channel notification delivery, and predictive analytics to provide timely weather warnings for farmers in rural Assam while handling intermittent connectivity and ensuring critical alerts reach users through SMS, WhatsApp, and email?"*

**Context:** Your WeatherAlerts component has translation features but needs real-time data integration.

### 6. **AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System**
**Complex:** *"What intelligent agricultural advisory system should I implement with machine learning models, crop-specific recommendations, and contextual AI responses to provide personalized farming advice for Assam farmers while integrating weather data, soil conditions, and regional best practices through a conversational chatbot interface?"*

**Context:** Your Chatbot component uses Groq API but needs better integration with farming data.

### 7. **Database Architecture & Data Management**
**Complex:** *"How can I design a scalable database architecture with proper data modeling, indexing strategies, and data validation to handle farmer profiles, agricultural data, payment transactions, and analytics while ensuring data integrity, performance optimization, and seamless migration from JSON files to MongoDB?"*

**Context:** You're using JSON files for farmer data but have MongoDB configured.

### 8. **Deployment & Production Environment Strategy**
**Complex:** *"What production deployment strategy should I implement with environment-specific configurations, automated CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring systems to deploy the frontend to Vercel and backend to Render while ensuring proper API URL management, environment variable security, and cross-origin resource sharing configuration?"*

**Context:** Your Donations component has hardcoded API URLs that need environment-based configuration.

### 9. **Mobile-First Responsive Design & Accessibility**
**Complex:** *"How can I implement a mobile-first responsive design system with progressive enhancement, accessibility compliance, and offline capabilities to ensure the platform works seamlessly across all devices and network conditions in rural areas while maintaining consistent user experience and performance optimization?"*

**Context:** Your components have responsive design but need better mobile optimization for rural users.

### 10. **Error Handling & Monitoring Infrastructure**
**Complex:** *"What comprehensive error handling and monitoring system should I implement with distributed tracing, automated alerting, and performance monitoring to quickly identify and resolve production issues in rural deployment scenarios while maintaining system reliability and providing actionable insights for continuous improvement?"*

**Context:** Your server has basic error handling but needs better monitoring for production deployment.
